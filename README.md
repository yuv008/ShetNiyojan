## Project Overview

ShetNiyojan integrates modern frontend technologies with advanced machine learning capabilities to create a complete farm management solution. The platform offers tools for each phase of the agricultural cycle - from planning and preparation to harvesting and distribution.

## Project Structure

The project follows a client-server architecture:

### Frontend
- Built with React + TypeScript + Vite
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Shadcn UI components
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- Interactive dashboards and visualizations
- Located in the `Frontend` directory

### Backend
- Built with Flask and Python
- MongoDB database for data persistence
- Machine learning models for crop recommendation, soil analysis, and disease detection
- AI-powered image analysis for plant health assessment
- RESTful API endpoints for frontend communication
- Located in the `Backend` directory

## Key Features

### Phase 1: Planning & Preparation
- **AI-Based Crop Prediction**: Get personalized crop recommendations based on soil composition, climate conditions, and historical yield data
- **Lease Marketplace**: Access equipment rental and field planning tools for efficient resource allocation

### Phase 2: Growing & Monitoring
- **Crop Health Monitoring**: 
  - Upload plant images for real-time disease detection
  - AI-powered diagnosis of plant health issues
  - Detailed treatment recommendations with dosage information
  - Voice input support for hands-free operation
- **Smart Irrigation**: Optimize water usage with intelligent scheduling based on weather forecasts and soil moisture levels

### Phase 3: Harvest & Distribution
- **Supply Chain Optimization**:
  - Transport route optimization for maximum profit
  - Market price analysis across different locations
  - Interactive maps for visualizing distribution options
- **Yield Management**: 
  - Comprehensive tracking of yields and performance metrics
  - Historical data analysis for continuous improvement

### Additional Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure mobile number-based login and registration system
- **Multilingual Support**: Language selection for broader accessibility
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices, from smartphones to desktops
- **Real-time Activity Tracking**: Keep track of all farm activities in one place


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

   npm run dev
   ```

4. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the Backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ShetNiyojan/Backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file based on the existing one
   - Add any required API keys for external services

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`
